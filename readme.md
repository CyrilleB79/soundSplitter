# Sound Splitter

* Authors: Joseph Lee and contributors
* NVDA compatibility: 2019.3 and later

This add-on, partly based on Tony's Enhancements by Tony Malykh, adds the ability to split audio from NVDA and other sounds onto separate audio channels. It also adds an unassigned command to toggle between sound splitter settings between balanced, NvDA on the left channel, and NvDA on the right channel.
